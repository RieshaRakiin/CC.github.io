    <h2>Basic Knowledge about Typhoons and Typhoon preparedness </h2>
    <p>A typhoon is a powerful tropical cyclone that forms over the western North Pacific Ocean, specifically between 180° and 100° longitude in the Northern Hemisphere [1].  These storms are known for their destructive winds and heavy rainfall.</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Region: Typhoons are distinct from hurricanes, which form in the Atlantic and Eastern North Pacific Ocean. They also differ from cyclones in other parts of the world which may have different naming conventions.</li>
    <li>Wind Speed: To be classified as a typhoon, a storm must have sustained winds of at least 119 kilometers per hour (74 miles per hour) [1]. This is the same wind speed threshold for a hurricane.</li>
    <li>Formation: Like other tropical cyclones, typhoons form over warm ocean waters, typically at least 26°C (79°F) at the surface [2]. The warm water provides the energy needed to fuel the storm's development. As warm, moist air rises from the ocean surface, it cools and condenses, releasing energy that powers the storm's rotation. The Coriolis effect, due to Earth's rotation, further influences the cyclone's circulation.</li>
